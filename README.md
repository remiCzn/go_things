# Go things

This repository aggregates personal projects written with [Go](https://go.dev/), but which aren't mature enough for me to turn them into individual repositories.

In particular, I use these various repositories to learn about the different things that can be done with Go:
- [go_antlr](./go_antlr/) contains an interpreter written with Go and ANTLR
- [go-todo-app](./go-todo-app/): contains a todo-list usable in CLI
